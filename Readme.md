# TARPG
TARPG (Tactical ARPG) is a prototype of a game made in Python with a [C++ demo](https://github.com/SkyMocha/TARPG_V2). 

Python was inevitable chosen as the main platform due to ease of prototyping. Both prototypes use [TCOD](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a base.

A full journal of the game's development (including video demos) can be found [here](https://www.skymocha.net/Projects/TARPG/).

## Current Functionality
* World generation using 2D OpenSimplex noise
* Player movement
* Ability creation & usage
* Semi-efficient rendering
* Vision circle
* UI (health circles reminiscent of Diablo)
* Game Logs

## Half-functional / In-progress
* Enemies & Enemy AI
* Biome generation not based on altitude
* Prefab generation (buildings, etc.)
* Custom map creation (not random-generated)
* Custom font for graphics
* Ability collision & functionality
* Commenting code :(

## Why open-source?
I am open-sourcing this project along with others due to the fact I will never complete them. In the end, these prototypes are just me messing around and having fun! Hopefully they're of some use to you, or just a fun thing to look at :)
